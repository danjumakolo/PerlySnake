               ----------

PerlySnake is a simple clone of the classic game
'Snake' written entirely in the Perl programming
language using OpenGL / GLUT.

To run the game, simply clone this repository and 
type  

               './snake.pl' 

on the command line, assumed that at least
Perl 5.10, GLUT is installed and the script has
corresponding rights set.

This is a translation and adjusted version of the
game written by Lars Heppert in his book 
"Coding for fun mit Python".
